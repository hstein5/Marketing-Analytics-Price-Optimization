# Marketing-Analytics-Price-Optimization

## Background
Pernalonga, a leading supermarket chain of over 400 stores in Lunitunia, sells over 10 thousand products in over 400 categories.  Pernalonga has two main levers to induce sales - shelf price and promoted price.  Product level shelf prices are increased to drive contribution and lowered to drive sales.  Pernalonga partners with suppliers to fund in-store temporary price reductions and derives about 30% of its sales on promotions.  

## Problem
Your analytics consulting firm was selected by Pernalonga (the client) to adjust list (shelf) prices to improve revenue.  While Pernalonga understands the benefits of data and analytics-driven decision making, it is constrained in resources to implement price changes to take effect in stores in the week of April 13-19, 2020 due to holidays in the week immediately preceding.  Specifically, it can only make price changes to the same 100 products across 2 categories (fresh products excluded) in 10 stores.  As supplier-funded in-store temporary price reductions on products are still being negotiated, you can assume the same promotion schedule as the same week in 2017, i.e., timing and product temporary price reduction levels are the same for corresponding weeks in 2017 and 2020.  You have two weeks to analyze the data and recommend price changes that will improve Pernalonga's expected revenue while maintaining overall profitability.

Your pricing model should at least consider the following factors:
- list price
- promoted price
- product affinity: substitutes and complements
- sales seasonality

Your price change recommendations should be realistic, reasonable and justified with price elasticity measures.  Minimum requirements:
- a list of 100 products with recommended price changes and justifications
- expected changes in sales quantity, revenue and profitability for each store and overall across 10 stores

Since the problem is on changing list prices, it is not necessary to analyze data in the customer dimension, but bonus points will be given if effects of recommended price changes on each customer segment's sales quantity, revenue and profitability are reported.
